# Administration

Administration is a different kind of administrator package for Laravel. We take a completely different approach to
the administrator backend. All assets are published, meaning you're free to modify absolutely everything about the backend.

Administration makes no assumptions to how to you want your backend, it merely scaffolds an entire administration panel
for your current application, complete with a secure setup process.

Every application is different, and you shouldn't be locked into an administrator panel managed by a different developer.
